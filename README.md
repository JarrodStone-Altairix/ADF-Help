# Altairix Help Site
This is a simple react web app with flask back end to help developers with a variety of tasks

## Website (Front End)

To run the website in develop mode, you will need to [install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

After, you can run it using the following command in the website directory:

```yarn start```

## API (Back End)

To run the api you will need to install [python 3.7 (or later)][https://www.python.org/downloads/]

After, run setup.bat or setup.sh in the api directory. This will create a virtual environment (.venv), which you should use to develop

To run the API server, ensure you are using the virtual environment and run the following command in the api directory:

Windows: ```.venv/Scripts/python app.py```
Linux/Unix ```.venv/bin/python app.py```
